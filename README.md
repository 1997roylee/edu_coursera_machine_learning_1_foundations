## WK 1 INTRODUCTION

### THE MACHINE LEARNING PIPELINE

    Data -> ML Method -> Intelligence

### CASE STUDY APPROACH

Use various ML Methods in different case studies

- **Regression** Case Study 1: Predicting house prices

- **Classification** Case Study 2: Sentiment Analysis

- **Clustering** Case Study 3: Document retrieval

- **Matrix Factorization** Case Study 4: Product recommendation

- **Deep Learning** Cases Study 5: Visual product recommender
